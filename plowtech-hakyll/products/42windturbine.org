*  Combining wind and solar  energy 
 Energy storage and charging tool to collect both solar and wind energy.

** Natural energy captured in two ways to ensure you are getting the most run time.
Using the winds kinetic energy and the suns rays, turning it into electrical power.
Besides off grid operations there are other benefits to wind turbines. 
Losing power can create financial set backs with downtime. Having wind turbines
storing up power in batteries will keep your site up during these times. At
Plow we like to suggest getting a solar panel to add another way of charging 
those batteries.  This hybrid design is great for areas with weather conditions 
that change rapidly. No grid connection requirements leaves the wind turbine 
open to be placed anywhere on site.   

** Teaming up with plow grants comfort that your site will have continuous power 
Plow technologies is constantly finding ways to simplify your industrial needs.
the newest addition is our wind turbine package that will provide an off grid 
power supply for constant energy or backup using batteries. The wind turbine
is capable working with winds speed of up to 79mph. Being made of carbon fiber 
with a aerodynamic designed to give peak performance in energy extraction from 
wind.  Our team will set up all equipment and provide you upon
installation with any information you need. Size and amounts of batteries will 
be worked out with you to ensure you have the energy support your looking for.
Batteries will include safe containers for there storage. Plow offers 24/7 support
