** Move on to more at your pace with Plow support
Some sites may not need a large power source.  Expenses for getting a power grid installed 
at locations can be very costly.  Solar power panels can provide energy to your smaller sites where
the location may be too far to provide energy while still making a profit.  Scheduling conflicts can  
also stall any location when waiting on electricians or inspectors.  By using solar panels, waiting
is no longer a problem.  You can begin making money faster.  Power outages can damage your equipment 
and cost you repairs.  Relying on the rechargeable battery eliminates that worry.  The size of our 
equipment makes it easy to relocate. Perfect for a growing site. 
** From installation till the last drop
Solar energy power packages come in assorted sizes depending on wattage needed. The entire unit runs 
off grid.  Our technicians are experienced in installation and trained to walk you through how the 
package works for you.   Installation of solar panels, if done wrong, will cause down times 
and endless service calls.  Once the solar panels are set up and tested to be operating to your
standards, PLOW has a tech support team available 24/7 to help with any issues.  Knowing the importance
of continuous run equipment, we have field team support also for those issues that can not be dealt with 
over the phone.
